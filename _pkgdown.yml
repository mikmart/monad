      A monadic object is a container for a value, or a value with a context.
      `fmap()` encodes what it means to apply a regular function in the context.
      `bind()` encodes what it means to apply a monadic function in the context.
      `join()` encodes how to flatten a layer of monadic structure.

      The `%>>%` and `%>-%` operators wrap `fmap()` and `bind()` for writing
      monadic data pipelines.

    desc: >
      Implementations of methods for the generics must follow certain rules.
      Functor Laws establish the requirements for `fmap()`. Monad Laws establish
      the requirements for `bind()`.
