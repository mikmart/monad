## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. To address the reviewer's comments I have:

* Removed all backticks from the DESCRIPTION file.
* Renamed the "list" documentation topic to "List" to avoid a conflict with
  base::list(). I believe this name conflict caused a false positive of
  "examples for unexported functions" in my earlier submission.

I'd also like to clarify that I don't have literature references to methods in this package.
